# OpenCircleMUD
Starting from a stock CircleMUD 3.1.  This will including updates and will be shared publically.
This code base is running at mud.amstadt.com 4000 and will continue to run there.  A website
for this project will appear at https://mud.amstadt.com as I move things along.  I'm completely
open to new contributions to this code base and the goal here is to stick with the LGPL license
that the original authors agreed to in 2020.  This is not intended to be the code base for a
single MUD but instead to be a code base that anybody can use.

If you are wondering why CircleMUD, it is because I really love it and I love the efficiency of
the C code.  My goal is to keep the code base alive.  If you'd like to contribute patches, I'd
encourage it.  Feel free to join in.
